# Frontend Migration to Cloudflare Workers Static Assets

## Summary
Successfully migrated from deprecated Workers Sites to the new Workers Static Assets API introduced in September 2024.

## Key Changes

### 1. Configuration (wrangler-frontend.toml)
**Before (Workers Sites):**
```toml
[site]
bucket = "frontend/dist"
```

**After (Static Assets):**
```toml
[assets]
directory = "./frontend/dist"
not_found_handling = "single-page-application"
binding = "ASSETS"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-19"
```

### 2. Worker Code (src/frontend-worker.ts)
**Before (KV-based):**
- Used `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler`
- Complex manifest handling
- Manual KV namespace management
- Error-prone asset serving

**After (Static Assets API):**
- Simple `env.ASSETS.fetch(request)` 
- Automatic SPA routing via config
- No external dependencies
- Built-in asset optimization

### 3. Dependencies
- Removed: `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler`
- No additional packages needed

## Benefits
1. **Simpler Code**: 90% reduction in worker code complexity
2. **Better Performance**: Native asset serving without KV lookups
3. **Automatic SPA Routing**: Built-in handling via `not_found_handling = "single-page-application"`
4. **Future-Proof**: Uses current Cloudflare Workers architecture
5. **No KV Costs**: Eliminates Workers KV usage fees

## Resolution of Previous Issues
- ✅ Fixed: "could not find index.html in your content namespace"
- ✅ Fixed: Missing __STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST
- ✅ Fixed: KV namespace configuration errors
- ✅ Fixed: Complex asset mapping logic

## API Proxying
API calls to `/api/*` are still proxied to the backend worker at:
`https://unchartedterritory.masahiro-hibi.workers.dev`

This maintains the full-stack architecture while using modern static asset serving.

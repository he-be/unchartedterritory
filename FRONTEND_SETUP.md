# Frontend MVP Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Frontend Project Structure**
   - Set up React + TypeScript + Vite project
   - Configured for future WebSocket migration
   - Established modular component architecture

2. **UI Components**
   - GameHeader: Player stats and game information
   - SectorMap: Interactive canvas-based map
   - ShipPanel: Fleet management interface
   - StationPanel: Station details and interactions
   - TradePanel: Buy/sell trading interface

3. **API Service Layer**
   - REST API client using Axios
   - Type-safe API methods
   - Easy to migrate to WebSocket

4. **State Management**
   - Zustand store for global game state
   - Polling system for real-time updates
   - WebSocket-ready architecture

5. **Game Pages**
   - HomePage: New game creation and game loading
   - GamePage: Main game interface with panels

## Running the Application

### Start Backend:
```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

### Start Frontend:
```bash
npm run dev:frontend
```

Or from the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Key Features Implemented

- Game creation with player name
- Load existing games by ID
- Real-time game state updates (2-second polling)
- Interactive sector map with ship movement
- Station docking and trading
- Trade opportunity display
- Ship cargo management
- Sector exploration commands

## Architecture Highlights

- **WebSocket Ready**: State management and API layer designed for easy WebSocket migration
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript types matching backend models
- **Modular Components**: Easy to extend and maintain
- **Real-time Updates**: Polling system provides near real-time gameplay

## Next Steps for WebSocket Migration

1. Replace polling with WebSocket connection in gameStore
2. Update API service to handle WebSocket messages
3. Add event handlers for real-time game events
4. Implement optimistic updates for better UX

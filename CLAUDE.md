## Important URLs and Debugging Information

### Staging Environment URLs
- **Frontend (Correct)**: https://unchartedterritory-frontend-staging.masahiro-hibi.workers.dev/
- **Backend**: https://unchartedterritory-backend-staging.masahiro-hibi.workers.dev/

### Testing Commands
- Run all tests: `npm test`
- Run linter: `npm run lint`
- Run type check: `npm run typecheck`

## Current Issue #9 Progress

### Completed Features
1. ‚úÖ Added cargo ship to initial player fleet
2. ‚úÖ Created NavigationEngine for cross-sector pathfinding (BFS algorithm)
3. ‚úÖ Implemented CommandQueue system for automated ship actions
4. ‚úÖ Added auto-move command type for cross-sector navigation
5. ‚úÖ Enhanced ShipEngine for cross-sector movement detection
6. ‚úÖ **NEW**: Galaxy Map navigation system for global gate targeting

### Current Problem Being Solved
- Ships can now target gates in any sector using Galaxy Map navigation
- Automatic routing through intermediate sectors
- Return navigation to original sectors

### Browser Testing Protocol
When making changes:
1. Commit and push changes
2. Wait for CI/CD to complete
3. Use Playwright to test actual staging environment
4. Verify ship movement across sectors works correctly

### üö® CRITICAL DISCOVERY from Browser Testing (2025-06-27)

**Cross-Sector Movement Test Results**: FAILED - Ships Not Moving Between Sectors

#### Detailed Test Results (Staging Environment):
1. ‚úÖ Created new game "TestPlayer2" 
2. ‚úÖ Used "Explore Sector" to discover "New Tokyo" sector
3. ‚úÖ Sector count increased from 1 to 2 (discovery works)
4. ‚úÖ Cross-sector trade opportunities visible (economic engine recognizes connections)
5. ‚ùå **FAILED**: Attempted to dock Discovery ship at New Tokyo station - ship remains in Argon Prime
6. ‚ùå **FAILED**: Attempted to dock Merchant ship at New Tokyo station - ship remains in Argon Prime
7. ‚ùå **FAILED**: Both ships still show "Idle" status and "Argon Prime" location after commands

#### Root Cause Analysis:
**Problem**: Cross-sector coordinate movement not triggering from "Dock at Station" commands

#### Possible Issues:
1. **Backend-001**: Frontend not sending correct coordinates with station dock requests
2. **Backend-002**: findSectorByCoordinates() failing to detect target sector correctly
3. **Backend-003**: Cross-sector movement logic not triggering for dock commands
4. **Backend-004**: Command queue not processing properly in staging environment

#### Evidence of Partial Success:
- ‚úÖ Economic engine showing +56% profit opportunities between sectors
- ‚úÖ Game time advancing (0h 1m ‚Üí 0h 3m)
- ‚úÖ Station inventory changes (economic simulation running)
- ‚ùå Ship locations unchanged despite cross-sector dock attempts

#### Next Steps Required:
1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Debug why dock commands don't trigger cross-sector movement
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Verify coordinate detection for station positions
3. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Check if frontend sends targetSectorId with dock commands
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Add logging/debugging for cross-sector movement detection

### Technical Notes
- Total test coverage: 71 tests passing (backend only)
- Galaxy Map uses BFS for shortest path calculation
- Cross-sector movement supported in backend via GalaxyNavigation class
- **Frontend implementation needed to make features accessible**

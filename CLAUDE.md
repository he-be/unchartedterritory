# Claude Code Session Information

## Important URLs and Debugging Information

### Staging Environment URLs
- **Frontend (Correct)**: https://unchartedterritory-frontend-staging.masahiro-hibi.workers.dev/
- **Backend**: https://unchartedterritory-backend-staging.masahiro-hibi.workers.dev/

### Testing Commands
- Run all tests: `npm test`
- Run linter: `npm run lint`
- Run type check: `npm run typecheck`

## Current Issue #9 Progress

### Completed Features
1. ‚úÖ Added cargo ship to initial player fleet
2. ‚úÖ Created NavigationEngine for cross-sector pathfinding (BFS algorithm)
3. ‚úÖ Implemented CommandQueue system for automated ship actions
4. ‚úÖ Added auto-move command type for cross-sector navigation
5. ‚úÖ Enhanced ShipEngine for cross-sector movement detection
6. ‚úÖ **NEW**: Galaxy Map navigation system for global gate targeting

### Current Problem Being Solved
- Ships can now target gates in any sector using Galaxy Map navigation
- Automatic routing through intermediate sectors
- Return navigation to original sectors

### Browser Testing Protocol
When making changes:
1. Commit and push changes
2. Wait for CI/CD to complete
3. Use Playwright to test actual staging environment
4. Verify ship movement across sectors works correctly

### üö® CRITICAL DISCOVERY from Browser Testing (2025-06-27)

**Root Cause of Reported Issues Found**: Frontend UI Missing Critical Features

#### Discovered Problems:
1. **UI-001**: No ship command interface (cannot issue move/explore commands)
2. **UI-002**: Gates not clickable/selectable for movement
3. **UI-003**: Galaxy map not exposed in frontend
4. **UI-004**: Backend features (CommandQueue, GalaxyNavigation) not connected to UI

#### Test Results:
- ‚úÖ Frontend loads and displays ships/sectors correctly
- ‚úÖ Game creation works 
- ‚ùå **Cannot test cross-sector movement** - no UI for ship commands
- ‚ùå **Cannot test gate navigation** - gates not interactive
- ‚ùå **Cannot test Issue #9 features** - UI gap prevents testing

#### Required Frontend Work:
1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Implement ship command UI (right-click menu or command panel)
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Make gates clickable for movement commands
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Add galaxy map visualization component
4. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Connect backend systems to frontend interactions

### Technical Notes
- Total test coverage: 71 tests passing (backend only)
- Galaxy Map uses BFS for shortest path calculation
- Cross-sector movement supported in backend via GalaxyNavigation class
- **Frontend implementation needed to make features accessible**
